WP Mail Pro Combines our WordPress Plugin, and Email Delivery Service to Create a Simple and Reliable All in One Email Solution for WordPress

###  Why a SMTP Wordpress Plugin?
WordPress uses a built-in email function called wp_mail to send emails from your website. This function uses the PHP programming language that powers WordPress to send emails.

A WordPress SMTP plugin has several advantages over using the built-in email function. The most significant advantage is email deliverability.

Any email messages that aren’t coming from a properly configured SMTP server with proper authentication are likely to trigger spam filters or get rejected. Those messages often end up in people’s spam folders or not delivered at all which can lead to customer service problems and other issues for the users on your site.

External SMTP servers like the one provided by <a href="http://www.WPMailPro.com" rel="friend">WP Mail Pro</a> are configured for the highest possible deliverability.

###  Reliable WordPress Email Delivery Has Never Been Easier

WP Mail Pro hosts its own mail servers optimized for sending WordPress emails. WP Mail Pro ensures the quality of our service from request to delivery of your emails.

With WP Mail Pro email delivery services, you can be confident that your email has the best chance of avoiding spam filters and successfully landing in the inbox.

###  Sending Emails In Just 3 Easy Steps
Step 1: Download & Install The Plugin
Step 2: Activate The Plugin
Step 3: Configure Your Sending Domain

Everything related to emails sent by our service can be viewed and managed from inside our plugin; this means that the user never has to leave their WordPress site to manage their emails. This greatly simplifies the use and the setup.
